# Mastermind

## Game rules

Mastermind is based on the classic board game that goes by the same title.
At the beginning of the game a secret five colors sequence is generated.
The player's goal is to guess the sequence within as few tries as possible.
With each try the player is given a list indicating the status of his shots for every position:

- yes - exact match
- no - the color doesn't exist in the sequence
- x - the color exists in a different place in the sequence

## How many turns do you need to guess the sequence?
